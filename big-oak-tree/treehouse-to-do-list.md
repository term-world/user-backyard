## SO YOU WANNA BUILD A TREEHOUSE

You've heard that the previous tenant at this house was an engineer.
And apparently, as one of their side projects, they were going to build a treehouse atop this `big-oak-tree`.
The nearby `clipboard-hanging-on-tree.py` has a bunch of calculations on one of its pages...
...specifically, the one labeled `ladder-and-base-calculations.py`.
It looks like it might be for determining the number of wood planks required to build a treehouse base?

The only problem is, that previous tenant must've been a *software* engineer,
because their calculations are all written in *code*...

A treehouse sounds nice, doesn't it? You'd like to pick up where they left off, but one problem:
You can't understand a *lick* of the code they've written, can you?

But maybe...you can figure it out? Working with your neighbors and some scrap paper,
see if you can figure out what each line of code is *doing*.
You'll notice some gaps between the lines of code that start with a `#`.
These are *comments*, and they don't actually *do* anything within code.
But, they're real handy for *documenting* what the code itself is doing.
Once you've worked out what you think the code is doing, take some time to fill in the missing comments.

As an aside, there's a nearby wood plank propped against the tree. It looks to cover 5 square feet.
This must be the type of plank the calcuations are for.
