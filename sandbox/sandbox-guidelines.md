IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR MODEL 100 CAMOUFLAGING SANDBOX, BELOW ARE SOME GENERAL USAGE GUIDELINES:

### CLEANING YOUR SANDBOX

YOUR SANDBOX MAY GET DIRTY FROM TIME TO TIME, AS SANDBOXES DO.
IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR SANDBOX CLEAN AND CLEAR OF UNWANTED CLUTTER, YOU MAY WISH TO SANITIZE OR `DELETE` SOME OF THE SANDBOX'S CONTENTS.
THIS IS PERHAPS MOST EASILY DONE BY USING OUR STATE OF THE ART `FILE EXPLORER` TOOL.
WITHIN THE `FILE EXPLORER` JUST FIND THE FILE OR FOLDER YOU WISH TO DELETE, AND RIGHT-CLICK.
THEN SELECT THE `DELETE PERMANENTLY` OPTION.

BE CAREFUL!
OUR SANITIZING PROTOCOL IS POWERFUL, AND USED IMPROPERLY IT HAS THE POWER TO SANITIZE (OR PERMANENTLY REMOVE) *ANYTHING*.
THIS INCLUDES FURNITURE, PRECIOUS USER MANUALS LIKE THIS, OR EVEN ENTIRE HOUSES!
**IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANYTHING DELETED IN THIS MANNER IS PERMANENTLY GONE AND CANNOT BE RECOVERED. USE CAREFULLY.**

YOU CAN ALSO ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT BY USING THE `rm` COMMAND WITHIN OUR ACCOMPANYING `TERMINAL WINDOW` TOOL.
FIRST, WITHIN THE `TERMINAL WINDOW`, NAVIGATE INTO THE FOLDER THAT HAS FILES (OR OTHER FOLDERS) YOU WISH TO DELETE.
THEN SIMPLY TYPE `rm "the name of the file you wish to delete"` AND REMOVE THE DOUBLE-QUOTE MARKS.
**IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANYTHING DELETED IN THIS MANNER AS WELL IS PERMANENTLY GONE AND CANNOT BE RECOVERED.**

### BUILDING NEW THINGS IN YOUR SANDBOX

OF COURSE, WHAT FUN IS A SANDBOX IF YOU CAN'T BUILD IN IT?
FOR THE SAVVY SANDCASTLER WHO WANTS TO BUILD IT ALL, THE CAMOUFLAGING SANDBOX 100 COMES WITH OPTIMAL ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES.
YOU CAN CREATE FILES AND FOLDERS WITHIN THE SANDCASTLE--AS MANY AS YOU'D LIKE!
YOU COULD BUILD A GOTHIC SANDCASTLE IN ONE FOLDER AND CREATE AN EDO CASTLE TO YOUR LIKING IN ANOTHER!
SIMPLY LEVERAGE OUR `FILE EXPLORER` TOOL TO MAKE NEW FILES AND FOLDERS BY RIGHT CLICKING ON THE `SANDBOX`.
YOU CAN ALSO USE THE ULTRA-MODERN `touch` AND `mkdir` COMMANDS IN OUR `TERMINAL WINDOW` IF YOU PREFER.
